# Malware Analysis and Dev.

## Aim
**Malware**, simply put is a special handcrafted software designed for various malicious purposes against the interest of a single individual or an organization. We aim to collect malwares (either old or new) and break it down using lab analysis and various reverse engineering techniques and tools to study its real purpose. We will go beyond just malware in Info Security by taking part in CTFs and participating in various onling platforms. The main aim is to learn Malware and have a good awareness of Information Security!

## Pre-requsites
- Solid understanding of fundamental programming, especially in C (dynamic memory allocation included)
- Having a basic understanding of computer systems.
- A basic knowledge in any domain of Computer Science helps here, because where there are systems there is a need for security.
- *System requirements*: The project is aimed at testing malware by running it in a virtual network of virtual machines, all of which is demanding on their RAM, CPU and Storage. Its also preffered for the mentor to have their preffered linux distro **dual booted** in their laptops/PC.

## Project Timeline (Tentative)
|Time|To learn|
|-|-|
|Before odd sem ends|Basic Computer Architecture (process execution, compilers & assemblers, ?de-assembly)|
|Dec 1st - 10th|Operating System fundamentals (processes, memory)|
|Dec 11th-21st|Introduction to reverse engineering tools and REMnux|

## Bonuses and Learning expectations
- Knowledge in any/all Computer systems domain: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Networks.
- Experience in using security tools. (too long to list all tools here :P)
- Good knowledge of Windows Operating System (file structure, powershell, etc...)
- Interest and/or awareness of System and Info Security.
